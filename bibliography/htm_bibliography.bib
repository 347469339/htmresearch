abstract = {In the field of cortical cellular physiology, much effort has been invested in understanding thick apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the regenerative sodium and calcium spikes that take place in the apical trunk. Here we focus on thin dendrites of pyramidal cells (basal, oblique, and tuft dendrites), and we discuss one relatively novel form of an electrical signal ("NMDA spike") that is specific for these branches. Basal, oblique, and apical tuft dendrites receive a high density of glutamatergic synaptic contacts. Synchronous activation of 10-50 neighboring glutamatergic synapses triggers a local dendritic regenerative potential, NMDA spike/plateau, which is characterized by significant local amplitude (40-50 mV) and an extraordinary duration (up to several hundred milliseconds). The NMDA plateau potential, when it is initiated in an apical tuft dendrite, is able to maintain a good portion of that tuft in a sustained depolarized state. However, if NMDA-dominated plateau potentials originate in proximal segments of basal dendrites, they regularly bring the neuronal cell body into a sustained depolarized state, which resembles a cortical Up state. At each dendritic initiation site (basal, oblique, and tuft) an NMDA spike creates favorable conditions for causal interactions of active synaptic inputs, including the spatial or temporal binding of information, as well as processes of short-term and long-term synaptic modifications (e.g., long-term potentiation or long-term depression). Because of their strong amplitudes and durations, local dendritic NMDA spikes make up the cellular substrate for multisite independent subunit computations that enrich the computational power and repertoire of cortical pyramidal cells. We propose that NMDA spikes are likely to play significant roles in cortical information processing in awake animals (spatiotemporal binding, working memory) and during slow-wave sleep (neuronal Up states, consolidation of memories).},
annote = {From Jeff: this is a short and relatively easy to read paper that covers the basics of NMDA dendritic spikes including some of the history.  It might be a good introduction to the topic.

        

        

        

        
The paper describes evidence for the HTM "predictive state". A non-apical NMDA spike can depolarize a cell body (page 2998, middle of right column). The time course of this depolarization is interesting - the paper shows evidence for a more sustained depolarization than we typically model in HTMs. This could be used to help combat temporal noise or it could support the "learn on one cell" mode.

        

        

        

        
They also provide evidence that NMDA spikes are highly localized events incorporating a small dendritic segment. They are localized in space (10-40 microns) and localized in time. See page 2998, middle of left column.},

abstract = {In several sensory pathways, input stimuli project to sparsely active downstream populations that have more neurons than incoming axons. Here, we address the computational benefits of expansion and sparseness for clustered inputs, where different clusters represent behaviorally distinct stimuli and intracluster variability represents sensory or neuronal noise. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we show that expansion implemented by feed-forward random synaptic weights amplifies variability in the incoming stimuli, and this noise enhancement increases with sparseness of the expanded representation. In addition, the low dimensionality of the input layer generates overlaps between the induced representations of different stimuli, limiting the benefit of expansion. Highly sparse expansive representations obtained through synapses that encode the clustered structure of the input reduce both intrastimulus variability and the excess overlaps between stimuli, enhancing the ability of downstream neurons to perform classification and recognition tasks. Implications for olfactory, cerebellar, and visual processing are discussed.},

abstract = {The term affordance defines a property of objects, which relates to the possible interactions that an agent can carry out on that object. In monkeys, canonical neurons encode both the visual and the motor properties of objects with high specificity. However, it is not clear if in humans exists a similarly fine-grained description of these visuomotor transformations. In particular, it has not yet been proven that the processing of visual features related to specific affordances induces both specific and early visuomotor transformations, given that complete specificity has been reported to emerge quite late (300-450ms). In this study, we applied an adaptation-stimulation paradigm to investigate early cortico-spinal facilitation and hand movements׳ synergies evoked by the observation of tools. We adapted, through passive observation of finger movements, neuronal populations coding either for precision or power grip actions. We then presented the picture of one tool affording one of the two grasps types and applied single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the hand primary motor cortex, 150ms after image onset. Cortico-spinal excitability of the Abductor Digiti Minimi and Abductor Pollicis Brevis showed a detailed pattern of modulations, matching tools׳ affordances. Similarly, TMS-induced hand movements showed a pattern of grip-specific whole hand synergies. These results offer a direct proof of the emergence of an early visuomotor transformation when tools are observed, that maintains the same amount of synergistic motor details as the actions we can perform on them.},

An "affordance" is the set of stuff that can be done to an object.  It is the possibility of some actions that can be performed on an object.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
Neurons in premotor cortex code for object specific and grip specific actions. (Rochat, 2010). A subset of these neurons fire for executing a specific hand-object and a specific visual representation of that object.

This paper shows that the same specific patterns observed in monkeys also occurs in humans.  They visually show specific tools to people, and observe very specific "motor plans" arising as a result of the stimuli. The main contribution is to "close the gap" between monkey and human data. In addition, they show that very specific visuomotor representations can form in humans as soon as 150 msecs after visual presentation of the object.  The did a TMS study, so the stimulated premotor cortex (they did not perform direct neural recordings).  They did record activity from hand muscles.

abstract = {The role of the cerebellar cortex in motor learning was investigated by comparing the paramedian lobule of adult rats given difficult acrobatic training to that of rats that had been given extensive physical exercise or had been inactive. The paramedian lobule is activated during limb movements used in both acrobatic training and physical exercise. Acrobatic animals had greater numbers of synapses per Purkinje cell than animals from the exercise or inactive groups. No significant difference in synapse number or size between the exercised and inactive groups was found. This indicates that motor learning required of the acrobatic animals, and not repetitive use of synapses during physical exercise, generates new synapses in cerebellar cortex. In contrast, exercise animals had a greater density of blood vessels in the molecular layer than did either the acrobatic or inactive animals, suggesting that increased synaptic activity elicited compensatory angiogenesis.},

abstract = {Cortical pyramidal neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs arriving at different dendritic locations with varying degrees of temporal synchrony. It is not known if different locations along single cortical dendrites integrate excitatory inputs in different ways. Here we have used two-photon glutamate uncaging and compartmental modeling to reveal a gradient of nonlinear synaptic integration in basal and apical oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Excitatory inputs to the proximal dendrite sum linearly and require precise temporal coincidence for effective summation, whereas distal inputs are amplified with high gain and integrated over broader time windows. This allows distal inputs to overcome their electrotonic disadvantage, and become surprisingly more effective than proximal inputs at influencing action potential output. Thus, single dendritic branches can already exhibit nonuniform synaptic integration, with the computational strategy shifting from temporal coding to rate coding along the dendrite.},
annote = {
        

        Summary of findings:
        

        

        

        
1) Proximal dendrites sum over their synapses linearly. Synapses sum linearly and inputs must converge at the exact same time. They also show that more distal dendritic branches show threshold like (sigmoidal) response properties.  This is nice confirmation for our model.

        

        
2) Distal dendrites have broader temporal integration windows. Quote: "We show that single cortical pyramidal cell dendrites exhibit a gradient of temporal summation and input gain that increases from proximal to distal locations. This suggests a progressive shift of computational strategies for synaptic inputs along single dendrites.”   

        

        
Near the base if inputs are more than a few msecs apart, the evoked potential drops significantly.  Confirmation that proximal dendrites act as coincidence detectors.   Segments farther away from the base can sum over longer temporal intervals.  At the most distal locations, evoked potential stays constant for much longer than 10 msecs.  

        

        
Another way to phrase this is that proximal segments require precise synchrony (coincidence detection), distal segments don’t require such precise timing.

        

        
3) More distal segments have higher gain (sigmoid gain) and require fewer synapses to fire. As a consequence, they also state that really distal segments can be as effective or even more effective than proximal dendrites in driving axonal output.   Not sure what to make of this.

        

        
4) They show all this in Layer 2/3 as well as Layer 5 pyramidal cells.

        

        

        

        Some reactions to temporal property:
        

        

        

        
We don’t model the timing property of distal segments today, but this property could be very useful. For example: 

        

        
Longer temporal scales can be helpful in dealing with temporal noise. A longer scale will make us more resistant to temporal insertions. It could also be used to create connections from a single segment to time steps t-1 and t-2. This will make us more robust to temporal deletions. (This is similar to our previous pooling idea.)

        

        
Distal inputs into L4 can be coming in at different time scales (motor commands could be slower than sensory input). A longer temporal integration period may be necessary for proper sensorimotor inference. 

        

        
If apical dendrites have much larger temporal integration windows, this could be very useful for feedback which necessarily has a slower time scale.

The minicolumn is a sophisticated local network that contains within it the elements for redundancy and plasticity. Although it is sometimes compared to subcortical nuclei, the design of the minicolumn is a distinctive form of module that has evolved specifically in the neocortex. It unites the horizontal and vertical components of cortex within the same cortical space. Minicolumns are often considered highly repetitive, even clone-like, units. However, they display considerable heterogeneity between areas and species, perhaps even within a given macrocolumn. Despite a growing recognition of the anatomical basis of the cortical minicolumn, as well as its physiological properties, the potential of the minicolumn has not been exploited in fields such as comparative neuroanatomy, abnormalities of the brain and mind, and evolution.},

But ongoing structural plasticity in the adult brain, including synapse formation/elimination and remodelling of axons and dendrites, suggests that memory could also depend on learning-induced changes in the cortical 'wiring diagram'.

Jeff says on the mailing list:

        

        
Classic Hebbian learning is about strengthening synapses, but we are suggesting that new synapses are formed. I think you are asking how this is possible biologically. 
The idea for “potential synapses” comes from a researcher Chklovskii.  An axon and dendrite that are near each other but that are not connected can still sense pre- and post-syaptic activity and this is sufficient for them to start to grow a new synapse when they are active at the same time. What is actually is grown is a “spine” that connects the axon and dendrite.  The synapse is on the end of the spine.  In addition, glial cells have been shown to act as intermediaries.  They can encourage a dendrite and axon to move/grow closer together when they fire at the same time.  Glial cells effectively increase the number of potential synapses.  Finally, the ends of the dendritic and axonal tress are constantly growing I different directions trying to find new useful connections.  It is now well known that synapses and spines form during learning and they also disappear.  This can happen rapidly, in a matter of minutes in some cases.

        

        
I believe the concept of potential synapses and the growth of new synapses applies to both proximal and distal synapses.  In our temporal memory implementation we decided to implement it differently purely to make the software more efficient and to use less memory.  Instead of maintaining a large pool of potential synapses, most of which would have 0 permanence, we choose from the set of active cells.},

Sensory information is believed to then propagate through the cortical column along the L4→L2/3→L5/6 pathway. Here, we show that sensory-evoked responses of L5/6 neurons in rats derive instead from direct TC synapses. Many L5/6 neurons exhibited sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials with the same latencies as L4. Paired in vivo recordings from L5/6 neurons and thalamic neurons revealed substantial convergence of direct TC synapses onto diverse types of infragranular neurons, particularly in L5B. Pharmacological inactivation of L4 had no effect on sensory-evoked synaptic input to L5/6 neurons. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two separate, independent "strata" of cortex in parallel.},

These signals, which are referred to as corollary discharge (CD), influence sensory processing in myriad ways. Here we review the CD circuits that have been uncovered by neurophysiological studies and suggest a functional taxonomic classification of CD across the animal kingdom.

The homogeneity of neocortex indicates that a sensitive objective should be able to explain response properties of different sensory modalities. The temporal stability objective was successfully applied to somatosensory and visual processing. We investigate if this objective can also be applied to auditory processing and serves as a general optimization objective for sensory processing. In case of audition, this translates to a set of non-linear complex filters optimized for temporal stability on natural sounds. We show that following this approach we can develop filters that are localized in frequency and time and extract the frequency content of the sound wave. A subset of these filters respond invariant to the phase of the sound. A comparison of the tuning of these filters to the tuning of cat auditory nerves shows a close match. This suggests that temporal stability can be seen as a general objective describing somatosensory, visual and auditory processing.},

abstract = {The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a preattentive component of the auditory event-related potential that is elicited by a change in a repetitive acoustic pattern. While MMN has been extensively used in human electrophysiological studies of auditory processing, the neural mechanisms and brain regions underlying its generation remain unclear. We investigate possible homologs of the MMN in macaque primary auditory cortex (A1) using a frequency oddball paradigm in which rare "deviant" tones are randomly interspersed among frequent "standard" tones. Standards and deviants had frequencies equal to the best frequency (BF) of the recorded neural population or to a frequency that evoked a response half the amplitude of the BF response. Early and later field potentials, current source density components, multiunit activity, and induced high-gamma band responses were larger when elicited by deviants than by standards of the same frequency. Laminar analysis indicated that differences between deviant and standard responses were more prominent in later activity, thus suggesting cortical amplification of initial responses driven by thalamocortical inputs. However, unlike the human MMN, larger deviant responses were characterized by the enhancement of "obligatory" responses rather than the introduction of new components. Furthermore, a control condition wherein deviants were interspersed among many tones of variable frequency replicated the larger responses to deviants under the oddball condition. Results suggest that differential responses under the oddball condition in macaque A1 reflect stimulus-specific adaptation rather than deviance detection per se. We conclude that neural mechanisms of deviance detection likely reside in cortical areas outside of A1.},
annote = {From EEG recordings, people know that unexpected stimulus ("deviant" sounds in this study), will elicit stronger response. This paper studies the neural mechanisms and brain regions underlying this effect in the primary auditory cortex. They confirmed that spiking response were larger when elicited by the unexpected stimulus, and the difference between expected and unexpected stimulus were more prominent in later activity. The unexpected stimulus can be introduced either in a oddball paradigm in which rare deviant tones are randomly interspersed among frequent standard tones (Fig. 1B), or in a random sequence where tone is unexpected (Fig. 1C). 

        

        

        

        
One downside of this study is they used a very simple sequence for the oddball paradigm. It will be more interesting to see whether the same phenomenon holds when they play a more complex tone sequence (an oddball within a melody). They conclude that the difference between unexpected stimulus and repeated expected stimulus is due to stimulus specific adaptation (rather than prediction).

This stimulation on a behaviorally relevant time scale evoked coordinated, complex postures that involved many joints. For example, stimulation of one site caused the mouth to open and also caused the hand to shape into a grip posture and move to the mouth. Stimulation of this site always drove the joints toward this final posture, regardless of the direction of movement required to reach the posture. Stimulation of other cortical sites evoked different postures. Postures that involved the arm were arranged across cortex to form a map of hand positions around the body. This stimulation-evoked map encompassed both primary motor and the adjacent premotor cortex. We suggest that these regions fit together into a single map of the workspace around the body.},

Fun paper to read. Lots of good references to other papers that stimulated various areas that project to muscle areas, and observed resulting behaviors. Eye saccades, head movements, mating behaviors, feeding behaviors, etc. The duration of stimulation ("stimulation trains") in these studies have to match the duration of the behavior.
In this paper they stimulated neurons in premotor cortex using "stimulation trains" of 500ms, much longer than previous studies. This allowed complex coordinated movements to unfold. One example stimulation caused the following behavior: left hand closed into a grip, the hand turned towards the face, the elbow and shoulders rotated to bring the hand smoothly to the mouth, and the mouth opened.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
Stimulation specified the final position, independent of starting position of the hand/arm. As such, this stimulation represents a "plan" or a "goal state". Different cells caused different behaviors (another nearby set of cells seem to encode moving the mouth to a particular configuration).

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
This implies that stimulating the same set of cells in premotor cortex can stimulate different sets of muscles depending on initial configuration. The paper directly verifies this experimentally. They also tested the velocity profiles and found that they exactly matched velocity profiles of normal skilled movements.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
They then mapped out hand positions. There is a topographic "map" of hand positions (Figure 5), but these are "goal" positions, not current positions. Stimulating a particular area would cause the monkey to move their hand to that area regardless of initial hand or body position. In some areas the mouth was also involved. In other areas the leg and feet were involved.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
This area also receives sensory input from multiple sensory modalities (usually both tactile and visual). They studied the effect of this input. For example, in one location the effect of touch or visual input near the arm, or electrical stimulation in that region, caused the monkey to retract its arm.   All the sensory areas they studied evoked flinching or avoiding behaviors. 

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
This is clear direct evidence that in premotor cortex we have SDRs representing goal states or high level “motor plans". These goal states represent desired end configuration of our body. Why is it an SDR? Only a small number of cells are invoked at any time. The rerepsentation is distributed: different cells corresponded to different (sometimes very similar) semantic goals.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
How does this SDR lead to actual muscle movements? There must be an associative mapping between current goal SDR, the current configuration (presumably proprioceptive sense) and the desired set of action potentials to the muscles. Presumably this happens in motor cortex and also in lower motor areas. It is not a strict hierarchy since premotor cortex also projects to subcortical motor areas. It may be that layer 5 computes this associative map.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
One key thing they emphasize is that brief stimulation of these areas only causes muscle twitches. You need to have extended stimulation (500msecs) before you get the complex behaviors.  This is one reason neuroscientists haven’t previously observed this type of reaction in this area.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a mechanism which the neocortex may use to store sequences of patterns. Storing and recalling sequences are necessary for making predictions, recognizing time-based patterns and generating behaviour. Since these tasks are major functions of the neocortex, the ability to store and recall time-based sequences is probably a key attribute of many, if not all, cortical areas. Previously, we have proposed that the neocortex can be modelled as a hierarchy of memory regions, each of which learns and recalls sequences. This paper proposes how each region of neocortex might learn the sequences necessary for this theory. The basis of the proposal is that all the cells in a cortical column share bottom-up receptive field properties, but individual cells in a column learn to represent unique incidences of the bottom-up receptive field property within different sequences. We discuss the proposal, the biological constraints that led to it and some results modelling it.},

Riesen's work suggested that this factor also operates in the development of higher mammals but he pro- posed that sensory-sensory associations are the prerequisite. To test these alternatives, visual stimulation of the active member (A) of each of 10 pairs of neonatal kittens was allowed to vary with its locomotor movements while equivalent stimulation of the second member (P) resulted from passive mo- tion. Subsequent tests of visually guided paw placement, discrimination on a visual cliff, and the blink response were normal for A but failing in P.

Experiment: two groups of kittens. One group (group A) saw a set of visual stimuli and was allowed to move around. The visual stimuli they saw was a result of their own movement. The second group (group B) saw the same visual stimuli but was not allowed to move around. In particular, group B saw the visual stimuli produced by group A’s movements. They achieved this by attaching pairs of kittens together in a gondola contraption. See Figure 1. (Note: kittens in group B were free to move around, but these motions did not result in sensory changes.)

We show (1) that temporal association learning provides appropriate invariance in models of object recognition inspired by the visual cortex, (2) that we can replicate the "invariance disruption" experiments using these models with a temporal association learning rule to develop and maintain invariance, and (3) that despite dramatic single cell effects, a population of cells is very robust to these disruptions.

Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback.

Here, we examine responses of a large number (>600) of neurons in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex with a large number (>1,000) of natural and artificial object images. During the recordings, the monkeys performed a passive fixation task. We found that the categorical structure of objects is represented by the pattern of activity distributed over the cell population. Animate and inanimate objects created distinguishable clusters in the population code. The global category of animate objects was divided into bodies, hands, and faces. Faces were divided into primate and nonprimate faces, and the primate-face group was divided into human and monkey faces. Bodies of human, birds, and four-limb animals clustered together, whereas lower animals such as fish, reptile, and insects made another cluster. Thus the cluster analysis showed that IT population responses reconstruct a large part of our intuitive category structure, including the global division into animate and inanimate objects, and further hierarchical subdivisions of animate objects. The representation of categories was distributed in several respects, e.g., the similarity of response patterns to stimuli within a category was maintained by both the cells that maximally responded to the category and the cells that responded weakly to the category. These results advance our understanding of the nature of the IT neural code, suggesting an inherently categorical representation that comprises a range of categories including the amply investigated face category.},

Here, a hypothesis is presented that the extraordinary performance of the cortex derives from an associative mechanism built in at the cellular level to the basic cortical neuronal unit: the pyramidal cell. The mechanism is robustly triggered by coincident input to opposite poles of the neuron, is exquisitely matched to the large- and fine-scale architecture of the cortex, and is tightly controlled by local microcircuits of inhibitory neurons targeting subcellular compartments. This article explores the experimental evidence and the implications for how the cortex operates.},

This degree of integration between the micro- and macroarchitecture, as well as inbuilt complexity at the cellular level, invites speculation about whether and how the whole system utilizes this feature. The importance of this mechanism conceptually is that the pyramidal neuron is able to detect coincident input to proximal and distal dendritic regions, investing the cortex with an inbuilt associative mechanism at the cellular level for combining feed-forward and feedback information.

The BAC firing hypothesis presented here offers a cellular mechanism that addresses a number of questions about the cortex. It suggests that the pyramidal neuron cell type is an associative element which carries out the same essential task at all cortical stages: that of coupling feed-forward and feedback information at the cellular level.

        

        

        

        

        

        
Feedback input to apical dendrites by themselves can cause strong action potentials.   If it is coincident with matching feed forward input, the cell bursting can be sustained for a period of time. This can happen if apical input is coincident with matching feed forward input. Mechanisms for that are reviewed. Figure 3a is an example of this.

We report the existence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) spikes in the fine distal tuft dendrites that otherwise did not support the initiation of calcium spikes. Both direct measurements and computer simulations showed that NMDA spikes are the dominant mechanism by which distal synaptic input leads to firing of the neuron and provide the substrate for complex parallel processing of top-down input arriving at the tuft. These data lead to a new unifying view of integration in pyramidal neurons in which all fine dendrites, basal and tuft, integrate inputs locally through the recruitment of NMDA receptor channels relative to the fixed apical calcium and axosomatic sodium integration points.},

abstract = {Object recognition is computationally challenging because each object produces myriad retinal images. Neurons at the highest cortical stage of the primate ventral visual stream (inferior temporal cortex; IT) likely underlie the ability of the visual system to tolerate that image variation -- their responses are selective to different objects, yet tolerant (“invariant”) to changes in object position, scale, pose, etc. (1-6). Understanding object recognition will require solving the mystery of how the brain constructs this neuronal tolerance. Here we report a novel instance of neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution. Specifically, we show that targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of unsupervised visual experience causes specific changes in the position tolerance (“invariance”) of IT neuronal selectivity. This unsupervised temporal tolerance learning (UTL) is substantial, increases with experience, and is significant even in single IT neurons after just one hour. Coupled with previous theoretical work (7-9) and the finding that this same experience manipulation changes the position tolerance of human object perception (10), we speculate that UTL may reflect the mechanism by which the ventral visual stream builds and maintains tolerant object representations. The relatively fast time-scale and unsupervised nature of UTL open the door to advances in systematically characterizing the spatiotemporal image statistics that drive it, understanding if it plays a role in other types of tolerance, and perhaps connecting a central cognitive ability -- tolerant object recognition -- to cellular and molecular plasticity mechanisms.},
annote = {They found neurons in monkey IT that responded strongly to a particular object “P” (preferred) and moderately to another “N” (non-preferred). Tested position tolerance of these objects to get a baseline.  The difference between the responses to “P” and “N” is the “selectivity” for this neuron.  They did this for about 100 neurons in two monkeys, and many different objects.

        

        

        

        
They then altered temporal contiguity of stimuli and tested the effects on these invariant representations. 

        

        

        

        
In the experiment, monkeys viewed altered stimuli for several hours. Basically there were three positions for each object: centered, 3’ above and below. For a given P object, the position above or below was designated the “swap” position. As eyes moved around, a P object would be shown in the swap position but was was replaced by the N object during saccade. (Each saccade lasts 23 msecs.) This would happen every time P object was shown in the swap position.  A P object in the non-swap position didn’t change when the money saccaded. (The swap position was randomly changed for different objects.)  The monkey is effectively blind during a saccade, so they don’t see the change - they just see the new object after fixation.

        

        

        

        
Their prediction: invariance selectivity at swap position would change. Selectivity in the non-swap position won’t change.  This is what happened. At swap position cells did not discriminate as well between P and N. Neuron became more responsive to N and less responsive to P, but only at that location. Change was location specific and shape specific, so very specific to this particular invariance. These changes cannot be explained by attention affects or retinotopic adaptation (everything was counter balanced). 

        

        

        

        
However another paper of theirs seemed to indicate that temporal contiguity alone was not enough. Looks like eye movements may also be required (this is their reference 10 - Cox and DiCarlo, 2005. Attached paper 2).

        

        

        

        
They call this effect “Unsupervised temporal tolerance learning” or UTL. This is just temporal pooling for us.  The behavior they describe is exactly the pooling behavior we would expect in layer 3. },

This review focuses on thin neocortical dendrites, which receive the vast majority of synaptic inputs in cortex but also have specialized electrogenic properties. We present a simplified working-model biophysical scheme of pyramidal neurons that attempts to capture the essence of their dendritic function, including the ability to behave under plausible conditions as dynamic computational subunits. We emphasize the electrogenic capabilities of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) because these transmitter-gated channels seem to provide the major nonlinear depolarizing drive in thin dendrites, even allowing full-blown NMDA spikes. We show how apparent discrepancies in experimental findings can be reconciled and discuss the current status of dendritic spikes in vivo; a dominant NMDAR contribution would indicate that the input-output relations of thin dendrites are dynamically set by network activity and cannot be fully predicted by purely reductionist approaches.},

abstract = {Visual stimuli that are frequently seen together become associated in long-term memory, such that the sight of one stimulus readily brings to mind the thought or image of the other. It has been hypothesized that acquisition of such long-term associative memories proceeds via the strengthening of connections between neurons representing the associated stimuli, such that a neuron initially responding only to one stimulus of an associated pair eventually comes to respond to both. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that individual neurons in the primate inferior temporal cortex tend to exhibit similar responses to pairs of visual stimuli that have become behaviorally associated. In the present study, we investigated the role of these areas in the formation of conditional visual associations by monitoring the responses of individual neurons during the learning of new stimulus pairs. We found that many neurons in both area TE and perirhinal cortex came to elicit more similar neuronal responses to paired stimuli as learning proceeded. Moreover, these neuronal response changes were learning-dependent and proceeded with an average time course that paralleled learning. This experience-dependent plasticity of sensory representations in the cerebral cortex may underlie the learning of associations between objects.},

We gave monkeys prolonged exposure to pairs of images presented in fixed sequence so that each leading image became a strong predictor for the corresponding trailing image. We then monitored the responses of neurons in the inferotemporal cortex to image sequences that obeyed or violated the transitional rules imposed during training. Inferotemporal neurons exhibited a transitional surprise effect, responding much more strongly to unpredicted transitions than to predicted transitions. Thus, neurons even in the visual system make experience-based predictions and react when they fail.},

To understand the dynamics of neocortical intrinsic activity better, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of populations of neurons from the primary visual cortex of awake mice during visual stimulation and spontaneous activity. In both conditions, cortical activity is dominated by coactive groups of neurons, forming ensembles whose activation cannot be explained by the independent firing properties of their contributing neurons, considered in isolation. Moreover, individual neurons flexibly join multiple ensembles, vastly expanding the encoding potential of the circuit. Intriguingly, the same coactive ensembles can repeat spontaneously and in response to visual stimuli, indicating that stimulus-evoked responses arise from activating these intrinsic building blocks. Although the spatial properties of stimulus-driven and spontaneous ensembles are similar, spontaneous ensembles are active at random intervals, whereas visually evoked ensembles are time-locked to stimuli. We conclude that neuronal ensembles, built by the coactivation of flexible groups of neurons, are emergent functional units of cortical activity and propose that visual stimuli recruit intrinsically generated ensembles to represent visual attributes.},

abstract = {Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field, and superior colliculus exhibit a pattern of activity known as remapping. When a salient visual stimulus is presented shortly before a saccade, the representation of that stimulus is updated, or remapped, at the time of the eye movement. This updating is presumably based on a corollary discharge of the eye movement command. To investigate whether visual areas also exhibit remapping, we recorded from single neurons in extrastriate and striate cortex while monkeys performed a saccade task. Around the time of the saccade, a visual stimulus was flashed either at the location occupied by the neuron's receptive field (RF) before the saccade (old RF) or at the location occupied by it after the saccade (new RF). More than half (52\%) of V3A neurons responded to a stimulus flashed in the new RF even though the stimulus had already disappeared before the saccade. These neurons responded to a trace of the flashed stimulus brought into the RF by the saccade. In 16\% of V3A neurons, remapped activity began even before saccade onset. Remapping also was observed at earlier stages of the visual hierarchy, including in areas V3 and V2. At these earlier stages, the proportion of neurons that exhibited remapping decreased, and the latency of remapped activity increased relative to saccade onset. Remapping was very rare in striate cortex. These results indicate that extrastriate visual areas are involved in the process of remapping.},

To observe both processes simultaneously, we performed long-term imaging of non-spiny dendritic arbors expressing a fluorescent postsynaptic marker protein as they arborized within the optic tectum of live zebrafish larvae. Our results indicate that almost all synapses form initially on newly extended dendritic filopodia. A fraction of these nascent synapses are maintained, which in turn stabilizes the subset of filopodia on which they form. Stabilized filopodia mature into dendritic branches, and successive iterations of this process result in growth and branching of the arbor. These findings support a 'synaptotropic model' in which synapse formation can direct dendrite arborization.},

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete - i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

We found that local NMDA spikes occurred in tuft dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons both spontaneously and following sensory input, and had a large influence on the number of output action potentials. Using two-photon activation of an intracellular caged NMDA receptor antagonist (tc-MK801), we found that isolated NMDA spikes typically occurred in multiple branches simultaneously and that sensory stimulation substantially increased their probability.

In apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons, calcium spikes are known to contribute to burst generation, but a comparable understanding of basal dendritic mechanisms is lacking. Here we show that NMDA spikes in basal dendrites mediate both detection and generation of bursts through a postsynaptic mechanism. High-frequency inputs to basal dendrites markedly facilitated NMDA spike initiation compared with low-frequency activation or single inputs. Unlike conventional temporal summation effects based on voltage, however, NMDA spike facilitation depended mainly on residual glutamate bound to NMDA receptors from previous activations. Once triggered by an input burst, we found that NMDA spikes in turn reliably trigger output bursts under in vivo-like stimulus conditions. Through their unique biophysical properties, NMDA spikes are thus ideally suited to promote the propagation of bursts through the cortical network.},
annote = {This paper makes the argument that dendrites preferentially respond (generate NMDA spikes) to inputs where the synapses receive small bursts of APs.  And that the post-synaptic cell is more likely to have a small burst of APs when the dendrites receive burst inputs.  HTM theory needs a method to distinguish whether and input to a region comes from a region that made correct predictions or whether the input to a region comes from a region that didn’t make correct predictions.  HTM theory needs this to know if the input should undergo temporal pooling or not.  Small bursts of APs are ideally suited to make this distinction, a burst indicating the cell had predicted its input.  For example Layer 5 cells that project through the Thalamus to the next higher region sometimes burst and sometimes they don’t.  The burst could tell the next region whether of not the Layer 5 cell had predicted its activity (via an NMDA dendritic spike).

        

        

        

        
The paper also discusses how input to the distal end of a dendrite will affect the input to the proximal end.  This fits nicely with the temporal memory concepts of HTM.

Here we use an advantageous model system--the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of weakly electric mormyrid fish--to directly examine how CD and proprioceptive feedback signals are transformed into negative images of the predictable electrosensory consequences of the fish's motor commands and/or movements. In vivo recordings from ELL neurons and theoretical modeling suggest that negative images are formed via anti-Hebbian plasticity acting on random, nonlinear mixtures of CD and proprioception. In support of this, we find that CD and proprioception are randomly mixed in spinal mossy fibers and that properties of granule cells are consistent with a nonlinear recoding of these signals. The mechanistic account provided here may be relevant to understanding how internal models of movement consequences are implemented in other systems in which similar components (e.g., mixed sensory and motor signals and synaptic plasticity) are found.},

abstract = {The visual cortex’s hierarchical, multi-level organization is captured in many biologically inspired computational vision models, the general idea being that progressively larger scale (spatially/temporally) and more complex visual features are represented in progressively higher areas. However, most earlier models use localist representations (codes) in each representational field (which we equate with the cortical macrocolumn, “mac”), at each level. In localism, each represented feature/concept/event (hereinafter “item”) is coded by a single unit. The model we describe, Sparsey, is hierarchical as well but crucially, it uses sparse distributed coding (SDC) in every mac in all levels. In SDC, each represented item is coded by a small subset of the mac’s units. The SDCs of different items can overlap and the size of overlap between items can be used to represent their similarity. The difference between localism and SDC is crucial because SDC allows the two essential operations of associative memory, storing a new item and retrieving the best-matching stored item, to be done in fixed time for the life of the model. Since the model’s core algorithm, which does both storage and retrieval (inference), makes a single pass over all macs on each time step, the overall model’s storage/retrieval operation is also fixed-time, a criterion we consider essential for scalability to the huge (“Big Data”) problems. A 2010 paper described a non-hierarchical version of this model in the context of purely spatial pattern processing. Here, we elaborate a fully hierarchical model (arbitrary numbers of levels and macs per level), describing novel model principles like progressive critical periods, dynamic modulation of principal cells’ activation functions based on a mac-level familiarity measure, representation of multiple simultaneously active hypotheses, a novel method of time warp invariant recognition, and we report results showing learning/recognition of spatiotemporal patterns.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: What roles do the different cortical layers play in visual processing? We recorded simultaneously from all layers of the primary visual cortex while monkeys performed a figure-ground segregation task. This task can be divided into different subprocesses that are thought to engage feedforward, horizontal, and feedback processes at different time points. These different connection types have different patterns of laminar terminations in V1 and can therefore be distinguished with laminar recordings.

RESULTS: We found that the visual response started 40 ms after stimulus presentation in layers 4 and 6, which are targets of feedforward connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and distribute activity to the other layers. Boundary detection started shortly after the visual response. In this phase, boundaries of the figure induced synaptic currents and stronger neuronal responses in upper layer 4 and the superficial layers \~{}70 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the hypothesis that they are detected by horizontal connections. In the next phase, \~{}30 ms later, synaptic inputs arrived in layers 1, 2, and 5 that receive feedback from higher visual areas, which caused the filling in of the representation of the entire figure with enhanced neuronal activity.

CONCLUSIONS: The present results reveal unique contributions of the different cortical layers to the formation of a visual percept. This new blueprint of laminar processing may generalize to other tasks and to other areas of the cerebral cortex, where the layers are likely to have roles similar to those in area V1.},

abstract = {In this book, two leading authorities on the thalamus and its relationship to cortex build on their earlier findings to arrive at new ways of thinking about how the brain relates to the world, to cognition, and behavior. Based on foundations established earlier in their book Exploring the Thalamus and Its Role in Cortical Function, the authors consider the implications of these ground rules for thalamic inputs, thalamocortical connections, and cortical outputs. The authors argue that functional and structural analyses of pathways connecting thalamus and cortex point beyond these to lower centers and through them to the body and the world. Each cortical area depends on the messages linking it to body and world. These messages relate to the way we act and think; each cortical area receives thalamic inputs and has outputs to motor centers. Sherman and Guillery go on to discuss such topics as the role of branching axons that carry motor instructions as well as copies of these motor instructions for relay to cortex under the control of the thalamic gate. This gate allows the thalamus to control the passage of information on the basis of which cortex relates to the rest of the nervous system.},

abstract = {Each of our movements activates our own sensory receptors, and therefore keeping track of self-movement is a necessary part of analysing sensory input. One way in which the brain keeps track of self-movement is by monitoring an internal copy, or corollary discharge, of motor commands. This concept could explain why we perceive a stable visual world despite our frequent quick, or saccadic, eye movements: corollary discharge about each saccade would permit the visual system to ignore saccade-induced visual changes. The critical missing link has been the connection between corollary discharge and visual processing. Here we show that such a link is formed by a corollary discharge from the thalamus that targets the frontal cortex. In the thalamus, neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus relay a corollary discharge of saccades from the midbrain superior colliculus to the cortical frontal eye field. In the frontal eye field, neurons use corollary discharge to shift their visual receptive fields spatially before saccades. We tested the hypothesis that these two components-a pathway for corollary discharge and neurons with shifting receptive fields-form a circuit in which the corollary discharge drives the shift. First we showed that the known spatial and temporal properties of the corollary discharge predict the dynamic changes in spatial visual processing of cortical neurons when saccades are made. Then we moved from this correlation to causation by isolating single cortical neurons and showing that their spatial visual processing is impaired when corollary discharge from the thalamus is interrupted. Thus the visual processing of frontal neurons is spatiotemporally matched with, and functionally dependent on, corollary discharge input from the thalamus. These experiments establish the first link between corollary discharge and visual processing, delineate a brain circuit that is well suited for mediating visual stability, and provide a framework for studying corollary discharge in other sensory systems.},

Here we consider circuits for solving this problem in the primate brain. Such circuits convey a copy of each motor command, known as a corollary discharge (CD), to brain regions that use sensory input. In the visual system, CD signals may help to produce a stable visual percept from the jumpy images resulting from our rapid eye movements. A candidate pathway for providing CD for vision ascends from the superior colliculus to the frontal cortex in the primate brain. This circuit conveys warning signals about impending eye movements that are used for planning subsequent movements and analyzing the visual world. Identifying this circuit has provided a model for studying CD in other primate sensory systems and may lead to a better understanding of motor and mental disorders.},

They are found in several regions of the CNS and, although the reasons for their abundance remain unclear, functional studies--especially of CA1 hippocampal and layer V neocortical pyramidal neurons--have offered insights into the functions of their unique cellular architecture. Pyramidal neurons are not all identical, but some shared functional principles can be identified. In particular, the existence of dendritic domains with distinct synaptic inputs, excitability, modulation and plasticity appears to be a common feature that allows synapses throughout the dendritic tree to contribute to action-potential generation. These properties support a variety of coincidence-detection mechanisms, which are likely to be crucial for synaptic integration and plasticity.},

To address this question, we repeatedly imaged individual pyramidal neurons in the mouse barrel cortex over periods of weeks. We found that, although dendritic structure is stable, some spines appear and disappear. Spine lifetimes vary greatly: stable spines, about 50\% of the population, persist for at least a month, whereas the remainder are present for a few days or less. Serial-section electron microscopy of imaged dendritic segments revealed retrospectively that spine sprouting and retraction are associated with synapse formation and elimination. Experience-dependent plasticity of cortical receptive fields was accompanied by increased synapse turnover. Our measurements suggest that sensory experience drives the formation and elimination of synapses and that these changes might underlie adaptive remodelling of neural circuits.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of cats show strong stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). In probabilistic settings, in which one stimulus is common and another is rare, responses to common sounds adapt more strongly than responses to rare sounds. This SSA could be a correlate of auditory sensory memory at the level of single A1 neurons. Here we studied adaptation in A1 neurons, using three different probabilistic designs. We showed that SSA has several time scales concurrently, spanning many orders of magnitude, from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds. Similar time scales are known for the auditory memory span of humans, as measured both psychophysically and using evoked potentials. A simple model, with linear dependence on both short-term and long-term stimulus history, provided a good fit to A1 responses. Auditory thalamus neurons did not show SSA, and their responses were poorly fitted by the same model. In addition, SSA increased the proportion of failures in the responses of A1 neurons to the adapting stimulus. Finally, SSA caused a bias in the neuronal responses to unbiased stimuli, enhancing the responses to eccentric stimuli. Therefore, we propose that a major function of SSA in A1 neurons is to encode auditory sensory memory on multiple time scales. This SSA might play a role in stream segregation and in binding of auditory objects over many time scales, a property that is crucial for processing of natural auditory scenes in cats and of speech and music in humans.},

Nice (important?) finding is that the surprise responses seem to be organized along columns. Consistent with surprise and bursting columns in our temporal memory.  This last part was the most interesting to me but it is just a side note in this paper. 
Quote: "Together, these data indicate that the tendency of an A1 neuron to undergo adaptation is independent of its tonal response prop- erties and that SSA is a neuronal property that seems to be clus- tered in “adaptation columns.”  (see bottom right of page 10442 to top right of 10444).

Stimuli were centered over the classical receptive field (CRF) and stimulus size was varied from one to four times the diameter of the CRF. Stimulus movies reproduced the spatial and temporal stimulus dynamics of natural vision while maintaining constant CRF stimulation across all sizes. In individual neurons, stimulation of the nCRF significantly increases the information rate, the information per spike, and the efficiency of information transmission. Furthermore, the population averages of these quantities also increase significantly with nCRF stimulation. These data demonstrate that the nCRF increases the sparseness of the stimulus representation in V1, suggesting that the nCRF tunes V1 neurons to match the highly informative components of the natural world.},

There are someproblems with the study. For one, the eye movements are not initiated by the monkey. Instead the movie simulates what the monkey might see during saccades. This is a huge issue. Their analysis also assumes there are no temporal correlations in neural activity. Another big problem since temporal pooling creates temporal correlations.  They don’t really think in terms of the monkey learning sequences. Etc.

abstract = {Neurocomputational models hold that sparse distributed coding is the most efficient way for hippocampal neurons to encode episodic memories rapidly. We investigated the representation of episodic memory in hippocampal neurons of nine epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring as they discriminated between recently studied words (targets) and new words (foils) on a recognition test. On average, single units and multiunits exhibited higher spike counts in response to targets relative to foils, and the size of this effect correlated with behavioral performance. Further analyses of the spike-count distributions revealed that (i) a small percentage of recorded neurons responded to any one target and (ii) a small percentage of targets elicited a strong response in any one neuron. These findings are consistent with the idea that in the human hippocampus episodic memory is supported by a sparse distributed neural code.},

@article{Wolpert1996,
abstract = {Based on theoretical and computational studies it has been suggested that the central nervous system (CNS) internally simulates the behaviour of the motor system in planning, control and learning. Such an internal "forward" model is a representation of the motor system that uses the current state of the motor system and motor command to predict the next state. We will outline the uses of such internal models for solving several fundamental computational problems in motor control and then review the evidence for their existence and use by the CNS. Finally we speculate how the location of an internal model within the CNS may be identified. Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The brain keeps track of the movements it makes so as to process sensory input accurately and coordinate complex movements gracefully. In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain, although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge, for example on visual processing, has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus, in the brainstem, through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in the prefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second, they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third, eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signals should, however, disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge, such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals, particularly in the realm of sensory perception, remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys, and some of these, too, may carry corollary discharge signals.},

@article{Yang2014,
abstract = {How sleep helps learning and memory remains unknown. We report in mouse motor cortex that sleep after motor learning promotes the formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on a subset of branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons. New spines are formed on different sets of dendritic branches in response to different learning tasks and are protected from being eliminated when multiple tasks are learned. Neurons activated during learning of a motor task are reactivated during subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep, and disrupting this neuronal reactivation prevents branch-specific spine formation. These findings indicate that sleep has a key role in promoting learning-dependent synapse formation and maintenance on selected dendritic branches, which contribute to memory storage.},
