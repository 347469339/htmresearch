Experiment 2
Generate sequences from an alphabet.
Train on sequences.
Test phase: Input sequence pattern by pattern. Sequence-to-sequence
progression is randomly selected. At each step there is a chance that the
next pattern in the sequence is not shown. Specifically the following
perturbations may occur:
  1) random Jump to another sequence
  2) substitution of some other pattern for the normal expected pattern
  3) skipping expected pattern and presenting next pattern in sequence
  4) addition of some other pattern putting off expected pattern one time step
