# SensorTag data analysis

* Change to `prototype`
* Run `python trajectory_converter.py` to convert the input files and generate the model params.
* Run `python run_models.py` to run the models on the converted data and generate the output results
* Run `python plot_results.py` to plot the converted data and associated anomalies.
* If all went well, the generated output will be located in `plot/results`
